WARNING: Work in progress

== Overview
A sample distributed service environment utilizing:

1. *Vagrant* - for machine orchestration
2. *Consul.io* - As a service registry & discovery platform
3. *Docker* - To host demo services
4. *Fabio HTTP Router* - As a front-end service router making it easier to address
a service at a specific address/port and have each request automatically redirected
and balanced across all available service instances
+
Utilizes Consul as a backend to automatically discover available
instances of a service

== Required Software

1. Vagrant
2. Virtual Box (currently it's the only provider supported in Vagrantfile)

== Quickstart

1. Add the `ubuntu/trusty64` Ubuntu linux box to your Vagrant installation by running
+
`vagrant box ubuntu/trusty64`
2. Clone this repository
3. From the repository location open a command prompt and run
+
`vagrant up`

Once the machines have been created and provisioned by Vagrant, you should be able to do
the following:

- Access the Consul Web UI to view all available services
+
http://172.28.128.30:8500/ui/
- View all services and instances registered with Consul by using
the Consul REST API(s) on any of the `ext-x` machines
+
*Examples:*
+
View all registered services
http://172.28.128.10:8500/v1/catalog/services
http://172.28.128.11:8500/v1/catalog/services
+
View details of a specific service
http://172.28.128.10:8500/v1/catalog/service/demo.svc.host1.inst1

- Access the Fabio HTTP Router Web UI to view all service instances
+
http://172.28.128.31:9998
+
The services can be accessed via the routers ip on port 9999
+
http://172.28.128.31:9999

== Minimal startup

- run `vagrant up ext-1 docker-1 consulclient httprouter`

== Machine Descriptions

1. ext-1, ext-2, ext-3
+
These machines host clusters outside of Docker. Currently only the Consul.io
cluster is hosted on these hosts. This may not be necessary but in the future
Docker Swarm may be introduced which also requires a Service Registry.
+
ElasticSearch master nodes may also be hosted on these machines in the future

2. docker-1, docker-2
+
These machines host Docker and automatically get provisioned with
+
- *Registrator*
   +
  Used to automatically register any running Docker containers with the Consul cluster
  making them available to be discovered
  - *Consul Client*
    +
  Used to communicate with the main Consul cluster hosted on `ext-1, ext-2 & ext-3`

NOTE: Registrator communicates with Consul via this container instead of the main Consul cluster
  nodes. Because the cluster nodes are responsible for managing cluster state/health, it is recommended
  to use lighter weight Consul agent in client mode to perform service registration/discover tasks

== Debugging
