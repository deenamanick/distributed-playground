WARNING: Work in progress

== Overview
This repository contains utilizes the following stack to create a distributed
service environment that could be utilized to experiment with micro-services,
ASP.NET Core and any other tech stacks that require some part of the stack
already available.

1. *https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]* - Virtual machine creation, provisioning & orchestration
2. *https://www.consul.io/[Consul]* - Service registry & discovery platform
3. *https://www.docker.com/[Docker]* - Service hosting environment allowing for easy deployment of multi-instance
services
4. *https://get.asp.net/[ASP.NET 5/Core]* - A demo service is written using ASP.NET Core and built as a Docker
image automatically as part of the Vagrant provisioning of the `docker-1` & `docker-2`
machines. This image is then used to create several instances of the service on each
host machine.
5. *https://github.com/eBay/fabio[Fabio HTTP Router]* - Front-end service router to make it easy to access services
via a specific address/port. Each request is automatically redirected
and balanced across all available service instances, wherever they are actually located
+
.Fabio & Consul
****
Fabio utilizes Consul as a backend to configure itself and immediately have new instances
of a service available for request routing (vs needing to configure a load balancer each
time an new service instance is available or moves)

== Required Software

1. https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant]
2. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtual Box]
+
Currently VirtualBox is the only provider supported in the repository's Vagrantfile.
This may be expanded in the future to work with Hyper-V/AWS/Azure/Digital Ocean
+
WARNING: If installing VirtualBox on a Windows 8+ machine, you will need to make sure
to disable and/or un-install Hyper-V before being able to use VirtualBox. Un-installing
the Hyper-V Windows feature should not remove any existing Virtual Machine images and
is fairly quick to do. This is one reason I would like to build Hyper-V support into
the Vagrantfile in the future.

== Quickstart

1. Add the `ubuntu/trusty64` box to your Vagrant installation by running
+
`vagrant box ubuntu/trusty64`
2. Clone this repository
3. From the repository location open a command prompt and run
+
`vagrant up`

Once the machines have been created and provisioned by Vagrant, you should be able to do
the following:

- SSH into the Docker hosts to inspect Docker container status
+
`vagrant ssh docker-1`
+
Once inside the Docker host, you can query Docker via
+
`docker ps` (view all running containers)
+
`docker ps -a` (view all containers)
- Access the Consul Web UI to view all available services
+
http://172.28.128.30:8500/ui/
- View all services and instances registered with Consul by using
the Consul REST API(s) on any of the `ext-n` machines
+
*Examples:*
+
View all registered services
+
http://172.28.128.10:8500/v1/catalog/services
+
http://172.28.128.11:8500/v1/catalog/services
+
View details of a specific service
+
http://172.28.128.11:8500/v1/catalog/service/demosvc.1

- Access the Fabio HTTP Router Web UI to view all service instances
+
http://172.28.128.31:9998
+
The services can be accessed via the routers IP on port 9999
+
http://172.28.128.31:9999

== Minimal startup

A minimal startup of the environment requires at least one Consul server, a
Docker host to run services on and the Fabio HTTP router.

To create and/or start only these Virtual machines, you can run:

- run `vagrant up ext-1 docker-1 httprouter`

== Machine Descriptions

1. ext-1, ext-2, ext-3
+
These machines host clusters outside of Docker. Currently only the Consul
cluster is hosted on these virtual machines. Doing it this way may not be strictly
necessary but in the future *Docker Swarm* may be introduced which also requires a
service registry to be available and I'm not sure if it can be hosted on the Docker
hosts being placed into a swarm.
+
ElasticSearch master nodes may also be hosted on these machines in the future

2. docker-1, docker-2
+
These machines host Docker and automatically get provisioned with:
+
- *Registrator*
   +
  Used to automatically register any running Docker containers with the Consul cluster
  making them available to be discovered
  - *Consul Client*
    +
  Used to communicate with the main Consul cluster hosted on `ext-1, ext-2 & ext-3`

NOTE: Registrator communicates with Consul via this container instead of the main Consul cluster
  nodes. Because the cluster server nodes are responsible for managing cluster state/health, it is recommended
  to use lighter weight Consul agent in client mode to perform service registration/discover requests
  which are then forwarded to the server nodes.

== Debugging
=== Windows 10

WARNING: I've run into problems individually updating and running the latest Docker Toolbox, Vagrant and Virtual Box
on the latest Windows 10 Update (Version 1511 - released March 8th, 2016).
Doing so may result in problems with Vagrant or the Docker Toolbox Quickstart Terminal not starting up properly due
to "Network interface issues"
This appears to have something to do with the discussion found here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33725779/failed-to-open-create-the-internal-network-vagrant-on-windows10

I was not able to get all 3 tools to work together until I did the following:

1. Uninstall Docker Toolbox
2. Uninstall Virtual Box
3. Download and install an older version (10.2.2) of Docker Toolbox
+
https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.10.2/DockerToolbox-1.10.2.exe
+
This version of Docker Toolbox will install the following software/versions
+
.ToolBox 1.10.2 Software
|===
|Package|Version
|Docker
|v1.10.2
|VirtualBox
|v5.0.14
